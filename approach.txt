1. Select XML parsing API
As per the problem statement we need to only read the XML file and considering memory consumption I decided to use SAX parser. 
while running the application on production environment we should be careful about the memory consumption.

2. Reporting Tool
I chose to use CSV file for report generation as it is easy and faster way of generating the Reports :)

3. Unit Testing Tool
JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. 

4. Create executable Jar
Need to create executable Jar file application so that user can easily run this application.

5. GIT Repository
