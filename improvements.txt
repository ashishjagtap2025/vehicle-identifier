1. In ReportWriter class we should APIs like OpenCSV to read/write csv file.
2. We can use Reporting APIs to show the reports instate of showing it in csv file. Like JasperReports or iReport.
3. Instate of using sysout statements we should use logging framework like log4j.
4. We need to add test resources into resource folder under test package.
5. We can create multiple classes for vehicle Types to achieve IS-A relationship between the classes like Car is a Vehicle etc.
6. As we need to compare Vehicle list and Wheel list thus we need to Write common method to compare list of generic type.(implemented)
7. Accept XML file and report file path as command line parameters while executing the jar file. (implemented)
8. Remove ArrayList<Wheel> from Constants class it will consume unnecessary memory. (implemented)

NOTE : Some of the points already covered in the given source code :)
